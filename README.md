About
----------------------------------------------

Water Rising is a console based game that strands the player in the middle of a rapidly flooding landmass. The player must survive long enough to create a source of food and pilot
off the island in a boat. The game is, at it's core, a text adventure, so your main form of interaction is typing commands into the box at the bottom of the screen. Use classic text adventure commands such as "chop down this tree" to achieve your ultimate goal of building a boat.
