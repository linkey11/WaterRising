About
----------------------------------------------

Water Rising is a console based game that slaps the player in the middle of a rapidly flooding landmass. The player must survive long enough to create a source of food, shelter, and eventually pilot
off the island in a boat. The game is currently in the early planning phase.

Some unique planned features:

- Text adventure style control and interface
- Random Terrain Generation (Limited in variety, but done)
- Open world
- Colored map
- Synonym database for flexible command recognition
- 100% less feature creep
