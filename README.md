About
----------------------------------------------

Water Rising is a console based game that slaps the player in the middle of a rapidly flooding landmass. The player must survive long enough to create a source of food, shelter, and eventually pilot
off the island in a boat. The game currently runs, but there is very little to do. Combat with inhabitants and local fauna will likely be introduced in a content update after the completion of the main game.
