About
----------------------------------------------

Water Rising is a console based game that slaps the player in the middle of a rapidly flooding landmass. The player must survive long enough to create a source of food and pilot
off the island in a boat. The main game content has been completed, and it is currently in a bugfixing/tweaking phase. Combat with inhabitants and local fauna will likely be introduced in a content update after the completion of the main game.

How To Play
----------------------------------------------
The latest release of the game can be found in the "latest" folder. Upon running WaterRising.exe, a new world will be randomly generated.

 - Type commands to interact with the world around you
 - The "1" key displays your inventory
 - The "2" key repeats the last command
 - The "3" key repeats the command before last
 - The command "score" will show you your current score for this game
 - The command "scores" will display the high score table

Tile Legend:

 - The ☺ character is the player
 - The brown ▲ characters are mountains
 - The dark gray ▲ characters are boulders
 - The purple ♣ characters are berry bushes
 - The green ↑ characters are trees
 - The yellow ║ characters are reeds

Tips:
 - Type the single letter "r" to repeat the last command once
 - Stand next to the tile you want to interact with, not on it
 - A good way to start out is by trying to build the boat, the game will tell you which items you'll need, which you can collect individually
 - Chopping trees and mining requires basic tools, try and make those first
